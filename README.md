# Project Description

***Ethical Software Artwork Management Continuous Integration Workflow for a Website, Book and Game***

### Need:
Developing large and complex digital tools requires software development skills making it difficult for artists to contribute without these. Also the more humans are involved in any project the easier errors are generated. We need to generate a repository structure and automated continuous workflow to handle a large media database made up of images, sound and video, which can be expanded and updated easily with a minimum level of technical skills and human intervention in the process of website population, book generation and game creation by different contributor teams.

### Approach:
We will develop a continuous integration workflow that automatically manipulates and transforms large media files such as large high resolution images, and associates necessary metadata and text content in bulk or individually and integrates these in the website, book and game.

(future) We need to have a polished workflow with supporting tools (such as a GUI application for the desktop computers, or at least a plugin for a good GIT GUI), that will help manage the process of updating and creating a pull request for the artists.

### Benefit:
Reducing the impact of human intervention, eliminating human errors and creating consistency as well as time savings in a project that is expected to grow with time as more and more media is generated for either three of the final products.

Allows artists to not depend on developers to grow the final products.

Ethical Software Limited can focus on the creation of quality media.
Ethical Software Limited can audit and review their media to verify its quality. Both at the stage of proposal (pull requests), and after merged.
Over time this public process allows outside contributors to participate in the review process and eventually also contribute quality media.

Consumers will always have access to the free and updated resources as soon as new media are generated and added to the database.

### Competition and Market solutions:
In the digital world there exist different Chinese language learning sites in addition to online dictionaries, games etc. but none with an automated continuous integration workflow for their media.

# Roadmap
You can find our official public project roadmap for the project [here](https://github.com/Nautilus-Cyberneering/chinese-ideographs/projects/2) . Our project roadmap is where you can learn about what features we're working on, what stage they're in, and when we expect to finish these.
Since we work with an agile approach this roadmap will get updated as work progresses to incorporate changes.

## Guide to the roadmap
Given that our project is rather small at the moment at this stage we have no separate repository for the roadmap.
Every item on the roadmap is a card since we are currently working with a private second project board in this same repository. 
You will see different cards that are called POC. POC standing for "proof of concept".

## Roadmap stages
The roadmap is arranged on a project board to give you a better understanding of what parts are planned to be worked upon during each coming quater. Every feature is added to a particular project board column according to the quarter in which it is expected be ready. 

The roadmap is subject to change, especially further out in time. You'll also find an Exploratory column, for when no timeframe is available yet for specific features.

## Disclaimer
The given product roadmap does not represent a commitment, guarantee, obligation or promise to deliver any feature, document, or part of the project by any particular date. The roadmap is intended to outline the general plan.
