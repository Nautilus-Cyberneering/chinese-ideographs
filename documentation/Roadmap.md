# Roadmap

You can find our official public project roadmap for the project [here](https://github.com/Nautilus-Cyberneering/chinese-ideographs/projects/2). Our project roadmap is where you can learn about what features we're working on, what stage they're in, and when we expect to finish these.
Since we work with an agile approach, this roadmap will get updated as work progresses to incorporate changes.

## Guide to the roadmap

Given that our project is rather small at the moment, we have no separate repository for the roadmap.
Every item on the roadmap is a card since we are currently working with a private second project board in this same repository.
You will see different cards that are called POC. POC standing for "proof of concept".

## Roadmap stages

The roadmap is arranged on a project board to give you a better understanding of what parts are planned to be worked upon during each coming quater. Every feature is added to a particular project board column according to the quarter in which it is expected to be ready.

The roadmap is subject to change, especially further out in time. You'll also find an Exploratory column for when no timeframe is available yet for specific features.

## Disclaimer

The given product roadmap does not represent a commitment, guarantee, obligation or promise to deliver any feature, document, or part of the project by any particular date. The roadmap is intended to outline the general plan.
